Bank Customer Churn Analysis : Analyzing customer behavior to identify factors contributing to churn and improve retention strategies in the banking sector.

Introduction On Dataset:
Customer Churn prediction means knowing which customers are likely to leave your service. This is because acquiring new customers often costs more than retaining existing ones. Once you’ve identified customers at risk of churn, you need to know exactly what marketing efforts you should make with each customer to maximize their likelihood of staying.
Customers have different behaviors and preferences, and reasons for discontinuing their accounts. Therefore, it is important to actively communicate with each of them to keep them on your customer list. You need to know which marketing activities are most effective for individual customers and when they are most effective.

Impact Of Customer Churn On Businesses :
A company with a high churn rate loses many accounts, resulting in lower growth rates and a greater impact on sales and profits. Banks with low churn rates can retain customers.

Benefits of Analyzing Customer Churn Prediction

1. Increase profits
Banks sell products and services to make money. Therefore, the ultimate goal of churn analysis is to reduce churn and increase profits. As more customers stay longer, revenue should increase, and profits should follow.

2. Improve the customer experience
One of the worst ways to lose a customer is an easy-to-avoid mistake like serving the wrong service. By understanding why customers churn, you can better understand their priorities, identify your weaknesses, and improve the overall customer experience.
Customer experience, also known as “CX”, is the customer’s perception or opinion of their interactions with your business. The perception of your bank is shaped throughout the Customer journey, from the first interaction to after-sales support, and has a lasting impact on your business, including your bottom line.

3. Optimize your products and services
If customers are leaving because of specific issues with your product or service, you have an opportunity to improve. Implementing these insights reduces customer churn and improves the overall product or service for future growth.
4. Customer retention
The opposite of customer churn is customer retention. Bank can retain customers and continue to generate revenue from them. High customer loyalty enables banks to increase the profitability of their existing customers and maximize their lifetime value (LTV).
